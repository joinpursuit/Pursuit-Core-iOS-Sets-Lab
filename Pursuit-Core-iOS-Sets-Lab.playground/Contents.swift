// Uncomment the "assert" lines for each problem when you have a solution, and run the playground to test.  When you have uncommented out the assert lines, no error messages or print statements means that your code is working correctly.

// Question One

// Create a new array numbersWithNoDuplicates that has all of the elements from numbers without any duplicates.  It should be in the same order as the original.

// Questions Two

// Create a new array scoresThatAppearOnce that has all the elements from scores that appear exactly once.  It should be in the same order as the original.

// Question Five
