// Uncomment the "assert" lines for each problem when you have a solution, and run the playground to test.  When you have uncommented out the assert lines, no error messages or print statements means that your code is working correctly.

// Question One

// Create a new array numbersWithNoDuplicates that has all of the elements from numbers without any duplicates.  It should be in the same order as the original.

let numbers = [1,1,2,4,4,4,6,6,7,8]

// Questions Two

// Create a new array scoresThatAppearOnce that has all the elements from scores that appear exactly once.  It should be in the same order as the original.

let scores = [1, 77, 83, 32, 77, 77, 83, 32, 99]

// Question Three

// a.

// Given arrOne and arrTwo, create a variable arrThree which is equal to the UNION of arrOne and arrTwo.  It should not contain any duplicate elements.  Sort arrThree from smallest to greatest.

// b.

// Given arrFour and arrFive, create a variable arrSix with is equal to the INTERSECTION of arrFour and arrFive.  If should not contain any duplicate elements.  Sort arrSix from smallest to greatest.

// Question Four

// Given the 4 arrays of Ints below, create a new array, sorted in ascending order, that contains all the values without duplicates.

// Question Five

// Determine if a String is a pangram. A pangram is a string that contains every letter of the alphabet at least once.

// e.g "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog" is a pangram e.g "The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog" is NOT a pangram

//assert(strTwoIsPangram == false, "Was expecting false, but got \(strTwoIsPangram)")
//assert(strThreeIsPangram == true, "Was expecting false, but got \(strThreeIsPangram)")
